Summary/Overview...

### User Assistance Developer
#### SAP | October 2020 onward

Summary of activities (what did I do), what I learned during my time in the position (in terms of technologies + also in terms of soft skills ), what tools did I use, any voluntary experience or trainings, changes in career directions and opinions. etc.

> I've spent significant time creating developer tutorials following a docs-as-code setup and supporting readers with any issues about them. I also create videos (one of them was for a project that won an internal SAP global user assistance contest), supported a few open-source projects also in a doc-as-code setup, and started learning python + have plans to learn java script to improve my skill set so I can be as good as possible in my job.

### Technical Writer

Summary of activities (what did I do), what I learned during my time in the position (in terms of technologies + also in terms of soft skills ), what tools did I use, any voluntary experience or trainings, changes in career directions and opinions. etc.

> The job as a technical writer involved testing new features and directly collaborating with development teams to ask about functionalities, report issues, and verify UI strings. While upskilling, I learned more about specific tech writing niches and approaches like developer documentation, API docs, docs-as-code, and static site generators. I built my first static site with Jekyll as I was trying to set up a new documentation workflow and introduce better tooling into my work. I realized I needed more trainings and interaction with senior colleagues in the field, so I decided to change jobs. I was asked to prepare interview questions and interview candidates for my role before leaving.
