### My role

More often than not, great documentation comes as a result of the collaboration of several people with different profiles. I worked on these tutorials as part of a small team consisting of myself, a development architect, an information architect, and another technical writer with a scripting expertise. Here's how I contributed:

- Pick up raw tutorial drafts from the development architect.
- Review and edit the tutorial from a language perspective.
- Install and configure any required tools to prepare my development environment for testing. 
- Test the tutorial step by step.
- Check code samples for correctness and compare with my testing project.
- Add prerequisites, steps, notes, tips, screenshots, and more context as needed.
- Note down any errors from the testing.
- Search through internal and external community discussions to find solutions for the errors and adjust the tutorial.
- Discuss tutorial scenario, structure, and any unsolved errors with the team.
- Make changes as needed and test again.
- Send the tutorial for testing to other colleagues. 
- Prepare and send for publishing.
