### Context
I wrote this concept topic in Oxygen XML Author. It represents the first stage of a bigger project I was leading. The project started based on customer requests and included initial research to collect information, starting a documentation update initiative for over 100 services, tracking the initiative progress in Jira, and consulting a large number of authors about how to comply with the documentation update requirements. As a result, services' documentation sets were updated to better respond to the customers' information demand.
