<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>I completed this exercise as part of a technical writing course I took in 2020 - <a href="https://becometechnicalwriter.com/">Become Technical Writer</a> led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-b-kennedy-a2458b224/">Bobby Kennedy</a>. I found out about the course from the Write the Docs’ <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/">Slack Network</a> where Bobby posted a call for beta testers. I was quick and lucky enough to respond and became one of the beta testers for the course. Later I also bought the course itself as I felt there was still a lot to learn (not to mention that all beta testers got a discount (: ). This exercise in translating overwritten English into plain language was part of the assignments I completed throughout the course.</p>

<p>I used Section 7 of Directive 024 of the State of Nevada’s Declaration of Emergency (<a href="/assets/docs/Directive-Face-Coverings.pdf">see the full declaration here</a>) as an example of how complex expressions in English can be re-written in a simple, more understandable way.</p>

<h3 id="original-text">Original Text</h3>

<p>SECTION 7: The mandatory provisions of this Directive shall not apply to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Children who are nine years of age, or younger. Children who are two to nine years of age are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings in public spaces.</li>
  <li>Individuals experiencing homelessness. Such individuals are encouraged to take protective measures to the greatest extent practicable.</li>
  <li>Individuals who cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition or disability, or who are unable to remove a mask without assistance. Persons exempted under   this provision should wear a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield. Persons exempted under this provision shall not be required to produce documentation verifying the condition.</li>
  <li>Individuals for whom wearing a face covering would create a risk to the person related to their work, as determined by local, state, or federal regulators or workplace safety guidelines.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are obtaining a service involving the nose or face for which the temporary removal of the face covering is necessary to perform that service.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are seated at a restaurant or other establishment th.at offers food or beverage services, while they are eating or drinking, provided that they are able to maintain a distance of at least six feet away from persons who are not members of the same household or residence.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are engaged in outdoor work or recreation such as swimming, wallking, hiking, bicycling, or running, when alone or with household members, and when they are able to maintain a distance of at least six feet from others.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are incarcerated. Prisons and jails, as part of their mitigation plans, will have specific guidance on the wearing of face coverings or masks for both inmates and staff.</li>
</ol>
