<p>Summary/Overview…</p>

<h3 id="user-assistance-developer">User Assistance Developer</h3>
<h4 id="sap--october-2020-onwards">SAP | October 2020 onwards</h4>

<p>Summary of activities (what did I do), what I learned during my time in the position (in terms of technologies + also in terms of soft skills ), what tools did I use, any voluntary experience or trainings, changes in career directions and opinions. etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve spent significant time creating developer tutorials following a docs-as-code setup and supporting readers with any issues about them. I also create videos (one of them was for a project that won an internal SAP global user asistance contest), supported a few open-source projects also in a doc-as-code setup, and started learning python + have plans to learn java script to improve my skill set so I can be as good as possible in my job.</p>

<h3 id="technical-writer">Technical Writer</h3>
<h4 id="effortel-technologies-sa--may-2018---sept-2020-2-years-5-months">Effortel Technologies SA | May 2018 - Sept 2020 (2 years 5 months)</h4>

<p>Summary of activities (what did I do), what I learned during my time in the position (in terms of technologies + also in terms of soft skills ), what tools did I use, any voluntary experience or trainings, changes in career directions and opinions. etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The job as a technical writer involved testing new features and directly collaborating with dev teams to ask about functionalities, report issues, and verify UI strings. While upskilling, I learned more about specific tech writing niches and approaches like developer documentation, API docs, docs-as-code, and static site generators. I built my first static site with Jekyll as I was trying to set up a new documentation workflow and introduce better tooling into my work. I realized I needed more trainings and interaction with senior colleagues in the field, so I decided to change jobs. I was asked to prepare interview questions and interview candidates for my role before leaving.</p>

  <p>Drafting patent applications for software inventions helped me learn more about how software works on the inside and polish my interviewing, simplifying complexity, and information structuring skills.</p>

<h4 id="lirex-com--feb-2013---dec-2014-1-year-11-months">Lirex COM | Feb 2013 - Dec 2014 (1 year 11 months)</h4>

<p>Summary of activities (what did I do), what I learned during my time in the position (in terms of technologies + also in terms of soft skills ), what tools did I use, any voluntary experience or trainings, changes in career directions and opinions. etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had to meet clients, understand what their problem was, map it to a solution, and then provide a technical description for the solution. During this time, I started to realize how much I enjoyed describing technical stuff in writing.</p>
